## Option 1: Technical Deep Dive

I'm excited to share my latest project: Vision Cam Chat - a real-time AI-powered image analysis application.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Full-stack TypeScript implementation with strict type checking
- Dual AI provider architecture (OpenAI GPT-4o, AWS Bedrock Claude)
- Modular component-based frontend design
- RESTful API with comprehensive error handling
- HD webcam capture (1280x720) with Canvas API
- In-memory image storage for security
- Production-ready with environment validation

**Architecture:**
The project demonstrates clean separation of concerns with:
- Backend: Node.js/Express with TypeScript
- Frontend: Vanilla TS with ES6 modules
- Services layer for AI provider abstraction
- Type-safe API communication
- Comprehensive documentation

**Key Learnings:**
Building this project reinforced the importance of:
- Type safety across the full stack
- Modular architecture for maintainability
- Security-first design principles
- Professional documentation standards

The complete source code, documentation, and deployment guide are available on GitHub.

## Option 2: Product-Focused

Introducing Vision Cam Chat: Transform how you interact with images using AI.

**What it does:**
Capture images with your webcam and instantly receive AI-generated descriptions. Ask follow-up questions about any details in the image through a natural chat interface.

**Why I built this:**
To explore the intersection of computer vision and conversational AI, while demonstrating production-grade software engineering practices.

**Technical Stack:**
- TypeScript (Frontend & Backend)
- OpenAI GPT-4o Vision API
- AWS Bedrock (Claude 3)
- Express.js REST API
- Modular architecture

**Features:**
✓ Real-time webcam capture
✓ Automatic AI analysis
✓ Interactive Q&A interface
✓ Dual AI provider support
✓ Secure API key handling
✓ Production-ready deployment

Available on GitHub with comprehensive documentation, deployment guides, and security considerations.
